NAME
    Net::Wake - A package to send packets to power on computers.

SYNOPSIS
    To send a wake-on-lan packet via UDP:
    Net::Wake::by_udp('255.255.255.255', '00:00:87:A0:8A:D2');

    Or directly from the command line:
    perl -MNet::Wake -e "Net::Wake::by_udp(undef,'00:00:87:A0:8A:D2')"

DESCRIPTION
    This package sends wake-on-lan (AKA magic) packets to turn on machines
    that are wake-on-lan capable.

    For now there is only one function in this package:
    Net::Wake::by_udp([$host], $mac_address, [$port]);

    You can omit the colons in the $mac_address, but not leading zeros.

    Generally speaking, you should use a broadcast address for $host. Using
    the host's last known IP address is usually not sufficient since the IP
    address may no longer be in the ARP cache. A $host value of
    '255.255.255.255' is implied if $host is undef. If you wish to send a
    magic packet to a remote subnet, you can use a variation of
    '192.168.0.255', given that you know the subnet mask to generate the
    proper broadcast address.
